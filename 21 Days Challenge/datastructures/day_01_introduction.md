# Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms
According to Wikipedia, "a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables
efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships
among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data."

## General Data Structures
The commonly used data structures are divided into two categories:
    1. Liner Data Structures
    2. Non-liner Data Structures
  
### Liner Data Structures
These data structures store data in a sequential manner. These are array, linked list, stack, queue, and matrix.  
### Non-liner Data Structures
These data structures do not have sequential relationship among data elements. These are binary tree, heap, hash table,
and graph.

## Python Specific Data Structures
These are specific to Python language and are namely list, tuple, and dictionary.
