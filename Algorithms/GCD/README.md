### Greatest Common Divisor
The greatest common divisor GCD(𝑎,𝑏) of two non-negative integers 𝑎 and 𝑏 (which are not both equal to 0) is the greatest
integer 𝑑 that divides both 𝑎 and 𝑏.

One of the key applications of GCDs are in cryptography.

#### {Problem}: Given two integers 𝑎 and 𝑏, find their greatest common divisor.
#### {Input Format}: The two integers 𝑎, 𝑏 are given in the same line separated by space.
#### {Constraints}: 1≤𝑎,𝑏≤2·10^9 .
#### {Output Format}: Output GCD(𝑎, 𝑏).
